# Messaging Web Application Documentation

## Step 1: Setting Up the Backend

### Project Setup

Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a new Node.js project:
```bash
npm init -y

Dependencies
Install necessary packages:

npm install express mongoose body-parser cors

## Database Setup

Set up MongoDB either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Connect your Node.js application to MongoDB using Mongoose.

### Backend Endpoints

Create routes for:

- Agent login/authentication.
- Fetching messages for agents.
- Sending responses to messages.

### CSV Data Import

Write a script to import the CSV data into your MongoDB database.

### Authentication

Implement basic authentication for agents using JWT or session-based authentication.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Frontend

### Project Setup

Create a new directory for your frontend within your project directory.
Initialize a new React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend

Dependencies
Install necessary packages:

cd frontend
npm install axios react-router-dom


//Components
Create the following components:

- AgentLogin
- MessageList
- MessageItem
- MessageForm
- App (main component to manage routes and state)

Routing
Set up routing using React Router to navigate between components.

API Integration
Use Axios to make HTTP requests to your backend endpoints.

Display Data
Populate MessageList component with data fetched from the backend.

User Interactions
Implement functionality to allow agents to view and respond to messages.

Styling
Apply CSS or use a UI library to style your components.

## Step 3: Integration and Testing

### Integration
Integrate the backend and frontend by ensuring they can communicate effectively.

### Testing
1. Test both the backend and frontend components thoroughly.
2. Check for edge cases and handle errors gracefully.

## Step 4: Documentation

### Backend Documentation
Document your backend endpoints, including their purpose and expected input/output.
Provide instructions on how to set up and run the backend server.

### Frontend Documentation
Document each component, detailing its purpose and usage.
Provide instructions on how to set up and run the frontend development server.

### Project Documentation
Write an overview of the entire project, including its purpose and architecture.
Include any additional information or considerations for future development.

** Step 5: Scripts**

**Backend Scripts**
Write scripts to start the backend server and import CSV data.

**Frontend Scripts**
Write scripts to start the frontend development server.

**Project Scripts**
Write scripts to start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

Feel free to customize this documentation further to suit your project's specific details and requirements!
